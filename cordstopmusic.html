        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        
        
        <p style="font-family:italic">Everybody loves music. Whether it’s one genre or another that we prefer, we can all agree that music is universal. What is it about music that makes it so appealing to us? Maybe its because music has the ability to evoke powerful emotional responses from within us. Think about it—we can all remember at least one song that makes us feel something when we hear it. It might be a song played at your high school graduation. Or maybe it’s a song that will always remind you of a painful breakup.</p>

        <p>We believe that every young person should have the chance to change their life through music.Yet our research shows that many can’t because of who they are, where they’re from or what they’re going through.<br>Our insights, influence and investment in grassroots organisations and to young people themselves means that more 0–25-year-olds can make, learn and earn in music.<br>Youth Music is a national charity funded thanks to the National Lottery via Arts Council England, players of People's Postcode Lottery and support from partners, fundraisers and donors.</p>
